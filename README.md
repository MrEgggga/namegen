# namegen

This is a pretty janky name generator program I made using Markov chains. You can use this program in two ways:

- Run `main.py` to start an interactive name generator, where the program gives you 10 names at a time and you pick your favorites; when you quit, 
the program shows you which names you picked as favorites.
- Import `namegen.py` and use the `generate_name` function, whichi takes two optional arguments for the minimum and maximum length of the name.

This program should work with just about any version of Python, including both Python 2 and Python 3.
